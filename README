Elevation is a route visualizer that renders GPS data in 3D space.

You'll need to have a GPS-equipped phone or device capable of tracking your 
activity as you run, hike, cycle, skate, ski, snowboard, or whatever other 
physical activity you choose to map. You'll also need the ability to export 
that data as XML, in either GPX, TCX or KML format. (If you have files in 
just about any another format, you can probably use GPSBabel 
[http://gpsbabel.org/] to convert them to GPX files and get them working 
with Elevation.)

Open ./data/xml/ -- there you'll see some example data called 
ExampleRoute05.gpx etc. that comes with the application; you can safely 
delete these example files and replace them with your own.

Once you've added your files, restart Elevation. To move the map around, 
use the controls underneath it. To rotate the view, click and drag within 
the viewport. To move faster, hold down the shift key as you press the 
buttons.

Elevation knows how to work with XML files in the GPX, TCX and KML 
formats. Due to inconsistent file structures, and thanks to Processing's
limited DOM traversal, it may not work with every such file. If not, get 
in touch; I can probably make yours work.
